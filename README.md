# SolFi Ear Trainer

SolFi Ear Trainer 3â„¢ (for iPhone/iPad) is an ear training application for students of music to improve their listening skills. It contains some basic exercises used by many schools to teach their students. It assumes the user has some knowledge of music theory.

It contains three exercises:

1. *Pitch Dictation* - Given a tonic note, one or more notes are played sequentially. The user is asked to annotate the sequence using solfege or pitch names (for perfect pitch/absolute pitch). The user can choose up to four parts.
1. *Chord Identification* - Three or more notes from a specific key are played melodically or harmonically. The user is asked to choose from a given set of chords and inversions.
1. *Interval Identification* - Two notes are played melodically or harmonically. The user is asked to choose from a given set of intervals. This can be used to improved one's relative pitch skills.


## Pitch Dictation
This exercise will help improve your listening skills using solfege/pitch names. A melody is played and you must identify each note in the melody using the notes on top. Your answer for each note appears on the bottom. Once you finish, press "Verify" to validate your answer. If your answer is correct, a new melody is played. If it is incorrect, the incorrect notes will be highlighted in red and the correct answer will be shown beneath each incorrect note.

## Chord Identification
This exercise will help you distinguish between different chords. Chords can be played harmonically/melodically (by changing the bpm setting) and ascending/descending. Correct answers will cause a new chord to play. For incorrect answers, the correct answer will be shown.

## Interval Identification
This exercise will help you distinguish between different intervals. Intervals can be played harmonically/melodically (by changing the bpm setting) and ascending/descending. Correct answers will cause a new interval to play. For incorrect answers, the correct answer will be shown.

## Keyboard
In landscape mode, a keyboard will appear to help the user with any exercise or just general practice.  When viewed from any exercise, the keyboard will highlight and scroll to the tonic note being used by the current exercise. It will also switch between solfege/letter notes depending on the exercise settings.

## FAQ
- **Q: I don't hear any sound from the application**
- A: Make sure your ringer switch is not set to silent and ringer volume is set loud enough.
- **Q: In the Preferences, how does the `One Octave Note Range` setting work**
- A: It restricts all notes for that exercise to one octave range (usually starting at C but some exercises allow the user to change it)
- **Q: In Pitch Dictation, how can I do perfect pitch training**
- A: In the preferences, set the `Note Name Type` setting to be `Letter`. That's it. Optionally, you can also change `One Octave Note Range` and `Tonic Note` settings as needed.
- **Q: In Chord/Interval Identification, how can I hear chords melodically**
- A: In the preferences, set the `Bpm` setting to be greater than 0.
